title: Blogging as a Motivational Tool

I love programming. But why don't I program more? I like to believe that I've
conditioned myself to chase those quick shots of [insert happiness hormone],
and those are easier found on Reddit and Hacker news than in projects that take
dedication and grit.

So far I haven't found a magic cure for that problem. Using a to-do list app to
create small chunks of work helps. So does making time for deep work. But all
those efforts are easily derailed by frequently checking news I don't care
about.

I hope that using this blog more often will serve as both a dump for random
thoughts but also as a dialogue with my past self. Additionally, it'll
hopefully motivate me to turn skimming of interesting GitHub projects into
really understanding the source code. So from now on I'll either not look at a
project or do a little write-up of how it works. At least that's the plan.
