title: Don't Buy Useless Crap

I recently bought new sneakers, the Adidas Deerupt in light gray (I'm sure the actual color name is a lot fancier). The light color contrasts nicely with my mostly dark pants. I can walk in them, they're pretty breathable and should I ever decide to start an Instagram career, my shoes won't hold me back. Great qualities, I know.

But they come with some significant downsides: They stain easily since dirt tends to be dark. The light fabric on the upper part of the shoe does not inspire confidence in their longevity. And most importantly, they're horrible for anything that's not walking or sitting (think running, or any kind of sport). I'd consider such shoes of limited utility and effectively niche foot wear, which became evident on a recent 7-day business trip.

For that business trip I brought my climbing shoes (which are an absolute must), the new sneakers and my Nike Metcon gym shoes. But bringing along two pairs of shoes (not counting my climbing shoes), when one would theoretically suffice, is a waste of precious bag space. Had I just bought the Metcons in a color that's not parrot-meats-christmas-tree-on-fire, I could have just stuck with a single pair. But due to their pretty wild colors, I'd feel uncomfortable wearing them when going to a slightly fancier restaurant or bar. Alternatively, I could have sold the old Metcons, and gotten the new Nike Free/Metcon crossover in black (I assume they're a bit nicer for walking than the rather rigid Metcons I have right now). The bottom line here is that the Adidas Deerupt is a one trick pony: it's a fashion shoe. Whenever I'm on a trip, I'll be bringing one pair of shoes which only fulfills a very niche role. I could easily save space and money by just buying more versatile shoes in the future.

Then there's the curious case of the Klean Kanteen. Many years ago I bought a Nalgene bottle. It has accompanied me on climbing trips, mountaineering excursions and during daily life, be it at work, at home or at the gym. It's BPA free, it's really sturdy, the lid strap can also be used to attach it to e.g., your backpack, it's light and it's pretty big.

Yet for some mysterious reason I one day decided that I wanted a Klean Kanteen bottle, just like the one my girlfriend has. It's smaller, not so easy to attach to your backpack and it's more expensive. It's insulated though, and it's probably made of equally good, if not better, materials. But is that really enough to justify buying a second such bottle when the one I already own is perfectly fine?

I could go on and on about all useless crap I've bought. I like mechanical keyboards. I owned 3. Then one broke and so now I'm down to 2. In hindsight I'd say that the perfect number of keyboards is 1. Then get a really nice sleeve so you can carry it around. And by all means, get the fanciest keycaps you can find, but just don't buy more keyboards than you can use at a single time.

Or what about the 3 pairs of headphones I have? The Sennheiser 650 are beautiful and a joy to use. But they're also useless if you're not alone, in a quiet room (they're open back). The Sennheiser Momentum 2 are more versatile in that regard, although their sound signature is not as pleasant as that of my former favorite pair of headphones - the Oppo PM3. But of course those were stolen from me. Oh and I also have Shure SE425 in-ear phones, because why not.

It would have made far more sense to get a single pair of headphones that is small, of really high quality, offers good passive and/or active noise cancellation, ideally comes with both cable and aptX bluetooth. Honestly, just because of how small in-ear headphones are, I'd say get those with custom fit earplugs.

This is a message to my future self. Think before you buy. Then think some more. Here are some rough guidelines:

- Do you already own something like that?
- Do you need it, or want it?
- Make sure it can be used in as many scenarios as possible
- Try it out before you buy it
- Buy the smallest possible item, unless that would mean sacrificing too much convenience
